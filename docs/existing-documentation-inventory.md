## Project-Level Documentation

### Core Project Files
- **README.md** - T3 Stack project overview with getting started guide
- **CLAUDE.md** - Clavix integration guide with slash commands and workflows
- **AGENTS.md** - Project agents configuration (likely AI agent definitions)
- **docs/project-structure.md** - Generated project structure analysis (just created)

### Framework Integration Documentation
- **.clavix/INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Clavix prompt optimization framework instructions
- **.clavix/QUICKSTART.md** - Clavix quick start guide

## Framework Documentation (.bmad/)

### BMad Framework (Extensive)
The project contains comprehensive BMad (Business Model Architecture Development) framework documentation including:

#### Agents Documentation (.bmad/bmb/agents/)
- Analyst, Architect, Dev, PM, SM, TEA, Tech Writer, UX Designer agents
- Specialized agents: quick-flow-solo-dev, bmad-builder

#### Workflows Documentation (.bmad/bmb/workflows/)
- Analysis workflows (product-brief, research)
- Planning workflows (UX design, PRD)
- Solutioning workflows (architecture, epics/stories)
- Implementation workflows (correct-course, dev-story)
- Support workflows (document-project, workflow-status)

#### Reference Materials
- Agent examples and templates
- Workflow templates and patterns
- Architecture documentation standards
- Testing architecture knowledge base

## Documentation Types Found

### User Guides
- T3 Stack getting started (README.md)
- Clavix integration guide (CLAUDE.md)
- BMad framework guides

### Technical Documentation
- Project structure analysis
- Agent definitions and capabilities
- Workflow definitions and templates

### Framework Documentation
- Comprehensive BMad framework documentation
- Clavix prompt optimization system
- Workflow architecture references

## Notable Gaps
No traditional project documentation found such as:
- Architecture decisions
- API documentation
- Deployment guides
- Testing strategies
- Contribution guidelines

## Assessment
The project has **extensive framework documentation** (BMad + Clavix) but **limited traditional project documentation**. The existing docs primarily focus on:
1. AI-assisted development workflows
2. Prompt optimization strategies
3. Business model architecture
4. Agent-based development patterns

This suggests the project is designed for **AI-assisted development** with strong emphasis on **structured workflows** and **prompt engineering**.
