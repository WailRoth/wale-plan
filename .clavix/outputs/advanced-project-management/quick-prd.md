# Advanced Project Management Solution - Quick PRD

Build a flexible, web-based project management solution that matches Microsoft Project's power while solving key limitations: inflexibility, high cost, and poor collaboration. Target users are organizations needing advanced project planning with complex resource management and multi-user access. Core features include Gantt charts with dependencies, WBS hierarchy, task constraints, and baseline management for project comparison.

Technical stack leverages existing project infrastructure: Next.js with tRPC for type-safe APIs, Better Auth for user management, Tailwind CSS for styling, Drizzle ORM for database, and React for frontend. Advanced resource management supports custom work hours and rates (e.g., 4h vs 8h days), resource allocation tracking, and time-based budget calculations. Multi-user organization structure enables synchronized data across teams without real-time cursor tracking requirements.

Scope focuses on web-only delivery with no mobile apps, file attachments, or calendar integrations. Essential features include Gantt visualization, task hierarchy with summary/child tasks, comprehensive tracking (status, progress, milestones), time tracking with planned vs actual comparison, baseline comparisons, and constraint-based scheduling. Later versions will add critical path analysis, resource leveling, custom fields, multiple views, and import/export capabilities.
